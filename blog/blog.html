      <p>One of the most frequently used sites that I go on is tumblr. It has a
        straight forward layout  that includes a feed of posts, a navigation bar
        on the top right corner,  search bar on the top left, and recommendations
        to the right side of the posts. Visually speaking, the graphics of the
        user interface is very simple in terms of design and color. The site is
        fully blue with hints of color for the various options to post. The visual
        design is simple enough to understand what each icon does and the dropdown
        boxes for the navigation gives a clear sense of what the icons include.
        The appeal of the user interface is that it has easy access to posting
        original content by the users from the icons to create either a Text,
        Photo, Quote, Link, Chat, Audio or Video post. There is also a pencil
        icon on the top right that leads to the same things. On each post throughout
        the feed, there r also buttons to reblog, like, or send the post for other
        users to see. It is effective in a way that allows the user to see what
        content they want in an infinite scrolling. </p>
